This repository contains a collection of various approaches to computationally search for physical laws directly from experimental data. 
Implementation of sparse regression, information criteria, physics-informed neural networks, neural ODEs, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), incremental learning and available tools such as PySINDy and DeepMoD has been explored.
